# Smart City Traffic Simulation App

## Overview
The **Smart City Traffic Simulation App** is a C++-based application designed to simulate and analyze traffic flow in urban environments. The app utilizes digital twin technology to create a virtual replica of a city's infrastructure, allowing users to test different traffic management strategies, evaluate their impact on traffic flow, and optimize traffic management systems.

## Features
- **Digital Twin Creation**: Create a virtual replica of a city's infrastructure, including roads, intersections, and traffic signals.
- **Scenario Simulation**: Simulate various traffic scenarios, including rush hour, road closures, and special events.
- **Traffic Flow Analysis**: Analyze traffic flow and identify areas of congestion, bottlenecks, and potential hazards.
- **Traffic Management System Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of different traffic management systems, including traffic signal control, lane management, and routing algorithms.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize traffic flow and simulation results using interactive graphs and charts.

## Technical Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or later)
- **Compiler**: GCC 9.3 or later
- **Dependencies**:
  - **OpenCV 4.5** or later (for image processing and visualization)
  - **Boost 1.73** or later (for C++ libraries and utilities)
  - **Qt 5.15** or later (for GUI development)
